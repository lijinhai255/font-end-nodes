# Implement built-in Exclude


```bash
Implement the built-in Exclude<T, U>



Exclude from T those types that are assignable to U



For example:



type Result = MyExclude<'a' | 'b' | 'c', 'a'> // 'b' | 'c'




```


```bash
type MyExclude<T, U> = T extends U ? never : T;

type Result = MyExclude<"a" | "b" | "c", "a">; // 'b' | 'c'

type Result1 = Exclude<"a" | "b" | "v", "v">;

```
